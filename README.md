Validating-Contact-Form
=======================

Simple contact form that uses Bootstrap and Font Awesome. Features HTML 5, JavaScript, and PHP Input Validation. Also includes dummy input field that is hidden from the user but will cause validation to fail if it is filled out (by a bot).

Enjoy!

At a bare minimum mailer.php must be customized with the following three variables filled out:
    $email_to = "EXAMPLE@EXAMPLE.COM";
    $email_subject = "CONTACT FORM EMAIL FOR EXAMPLE.COM";
    $source = "EXAMPLE@EXAMPLE.COM";
